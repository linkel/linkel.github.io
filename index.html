        <h2>About Me <div class="tiny">updated Jan 2021</div></h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a software engineer. I work for a data visualization company, and previously worked at a fleet telematics company. 
          Before I discovered the joy of software, I was a researcher doing analytical and formulation chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I love learning more about how things work and how they came to be. The universe is vast and within every slice of a discipline 
          we can always encounter more; at every layer of knowledge and experience there exists infinite detail.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I have been lucky to gallivant around several different fields and domains. There is always so much to learn--about small molecules and proteins, about software design, and most importantly, about people. 
        </p>
        <h2>Fun Things<div class="tiny">updated Dec 2021</div></h2>
        <p>
          My current fitness schtick is a mix of rock climbing (mostly indoor bouldering and a smidgen of toprope and lead) and compound barbell movements, excluding squats. I dropped barbell squats from my routine because it affected climbing recovery significantly. 
          Bench and deadlift seem fine to retain with less volume, and I've been experimenting with some grip workouts and adding more pullups.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm extremely thrilled that gyms probably won't close again for the Omicron variant of Covid. Man, remember when we were all calling it the coronavirus back in Mar 2020?
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been sketching sporadically, but I haven't been consistent about that. Drawing is more of a "do it if I feel like it" hobby. I really enjoy my Pentel GraphGear 1000 for pencil drawing. I also like writing notes with Pentel EnerGel 0.5mm, and Sakura Pigma Micron 05 for cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also been playing Age of Empires IV trying to get all the Steam achievements.
        </p>
        <h2>Current Tech-Related Focus </h2>
        <p>
          Still working on being more thoughtful about "just getting it to work" versus maintainability of code. 
          Trying to improve at reviewing code and keeping the business purpose in mind alongside the nitty-gritty specifications when understanding why the code was written.
        </p>
        <h2>Tech Topics on Rotation</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes I revisit Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual. Last year, I started a book on computer networking (Jim Kurose's Computer Networking, a Top-Down Approach). 
          Also bought Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective by Randal Bryant. 
          Haven't worked on this since Sep 2020, but The Elements of Computing Systems (also known as nand2tetris). I'm on Chapter 10, which is about writing the compiler that converts the high-level language to the VM language.
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <h3>Things I've touched</h3>
        <p>Python, C, C#/Unity, .NET, Racket (a Lisp), JavaScript, TypeScript, React, AWS-related bits, Angular 2+, MSSQL, PostgresQL, Java, Standard Meta Language</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I'm currently touching the most</h3>
        <p>TypeScript, React, Java</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I want to touch aspirationally</h3>
        <p>More Lisp, Rust, Haskell</p>
