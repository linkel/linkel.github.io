        <h2>About Me <div class="tiny">updated Nov 2022</div></h2>
        <p>
          As a software engineer, I have written software for a fleet telematics company, a data visualization company, and I currently work at a cloud database company.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a chemist, I have formulated and analyzed drugs ranging from peptides, hormones, anti-cancer drugs, opioids, vasopressors and more. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I simultaneously enjoy variety and consistency--which I don't believe to be a paradox.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love learning, making plans, and executing them. I enjoy the process of iteration and I like to think I voraciously apply it in multiple domains of my life.
        </p> 
        <h2>Fun Things<div class="tiny">updated Nov 2022</div></h2>
        <p>
          2022 has been a seriously fun year. I started sport climbing outdoors this summer and visited crags in North Bend, Mt. Erie, Frenchman Coulee, and Squamish for the first time.
          I've had the fortune of meeting many new friends who are positive, driven, and stoked to climb--and also lucky to accumulate more climbing trips with a set of great people. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One challenge continues to be balancing my enjoyment of the classic deadlift and bench press with the recovery time that climbing skill acquisition seems to require from me. 
          I love that climbing gyms have power cages, barbells, and an assortment of free weights. I have started playing around with hangboarding and spray walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been sketching sporadically, but I haven't been consistent about that. Drawing is more of a "do it if I feel like it" hobby. I really enjoy my Pentel GraphGear 1000 for pencil drawing. I also like writing notes with Pentel EnerGel 0.5mm, and Sakura Pigma Micron 05 for making holiday and birthday cards.
        </p>

          I got 100% of the Steam achievements for Age of Empires IV...

        <h2>Current Tech-Related Focus </h2>
        <p>
          Make it work, make it right, make it fast...
        </p>
        <p>
          Working on being aware of tradeoffs with every design decision. Paying attention to how more senior engineers make architectural decisions and what they do when they hit gnarly problems.
          Looking for ways to review code more efficiently and informatively. Understanding how to accumulate beneficial influence in an organization and advocate for myself, my team, and the good of the company.
        </p>
