        <h2>About Me <div class="tiny">updated June 2019</div></h2>
        <p>
          Currently in the glorious honeymoon period of working as a software engineer. 
          Basking in the frequent dopamine hits of solving problems at work daily. Not a bad life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to software engineering, I was a formulation chemist in the pharmaceutical industry. 
          There was a great deal of manual data entry for each experiment, so to save myself from the tedium I learned how to use Python, PowerShell, and AutoHotKey to automate it. 
          Along the way I discovered that I loved to solve problems with code. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I toyed with the idea of making a career change in June 2018, then became serious about it that October. After a whirl of interviewing in January 2019, I found myself with job offers in February. 
          I know a slew of others who have similar stories--can't quite imagine any other lucrative profession that allows such a pivot in a relatively short timeframe. 
        </p>
        <h2>Current Focus <div class="tiny">updated June 2019</div></h2>
        <p>
          Trying to get my code cleaner. Some books I am reading or revisiting include Clean Code and The Pragmatic Programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also working on building up the CS knowledge that I lack. Delved a little bit into functional programming through an SML course. Right now exploring some math (predicate logic, set theory, probability) through MIT 6.042.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the physical domain, I'm currently invested in trying to get a consistent 5 - 10 second freestanding handstand. 
          It's nuts how much shoulder, hamstring, and wrist flexibility is necessary. Powerlifting didn't need that much flexibility from me so I happily became a gnarled mess.
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <h3>Things I've touched</h3>
        <p>Python, C, JavaScript, MongoDB, React, Java, nand2tetris' HDL, Standard Meta Language</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I'm touching</h3>
        <p>C#, .NET, TypeScript, SQL, Python (yes it's on here twice)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I want to touch aspirationally</h3>
        <p>Lisp, Rust, Haskell, Golang, Scala, too many things, need to prioritize</p>
