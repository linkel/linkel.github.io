        <h2>About Me <div class="tiny">updated Jan 2021</div></h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a software engineer. I work for a data visualization company, and previously worked at a fleet telematics company. 
          Before I discovered the joy of software, I was a researcher doing analytical and formulation chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I love learning more about how things work and how they came to be. The universe is vast and within every slice of a discipline 
          we can always encounter more; at every layer of knowledge and experience there exists infinite detail.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I have been lucky to gallivant around several different fields and domains. There is always so much to learn--about small molecules and proteins, about software design, and most importantly, about people. 
        </p>
        <h2>Fun Things<div class="tiny">updated Jan 2021</div></h2>
        <p>
          I was on a minimal barbell strength maintenance routine while I was exploring rock climbing, before the pandemic caused gyms to close. Wow! That sentence has such a post-apocalyptic vibe. I was primarily doing bouldering.
          The routine was basically front squats + bench press + deadlifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the gym closure I've started to dabble at drawing and music again. Had to set up a calisthenics and light running routine and bought a hangboard for maintaining finger strength. Also attempting to improve my flexibility for once.
        </p>
        <h2>Current Tech-Related Focus </h2>
        <p>
          Working on being more thoughtful about "just getting it to work" versus maintainability of code. 
          Gaining more understanding around functional programming. Thin imperative shells around pure functional cores, that kind of delicious thing. Was playing around with Racket, a Lisp dialect.  
        </p>
        <h2>Tech Topics on Rotation</h2>
        <p>
          Would like to finish The Elements of Computing Systems (also known as nand2tetris). I'm on Chapter 10, which is about writing the compiler that converts the high-level language to the VM language.
          Been slowly chewing through Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual. 
          Started a book on computer networking. 
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <h3>Things I've touched</h3>
        <p>Python, C, C#/Unity, .NET, Racket (a Lisp), JavaScript, TypeScript, React, AWS-related bits, Angular 2+, MSSQL, Java, Standard Meta Language</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I'm currently touching the most</h3>
        <p>TypeScript, React</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Things I want to touch aspirationally</h3>
        <p>More Lisp, Rust, Haskell</p>
