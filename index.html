            About Me and Software
            <div class="tiny">updated Dec 2023</div>
          </h2>
          <p>
            I like writing software as part of happy teams with high levels of
            autonomy who are excited about their product. My first software
            engineering position was at a fleet telematics company that had
            positive people who were glad to mentor new engineers, which left an
            impression on me for how I'd like to contribute to others' growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            I next spent time at Tableau, a data visualization company acquired
            by Salesforce. There, I primarily worked on Tableau's Virtual
            Connections content type which shipped in 2021. The goal with that
            was to give people better ways to manage row-level security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I work at Snowflake, a cloud database company. The storage
            and compute separation at Snowflake makes it very easy for users to
            scale as needed per query. The way it mostly works out of the box
            means that people can focus on shaping and analyzing their data
            rather than fiddling with optimization and configuration of a data
            warehouse. It's honestly a pretty cool product.
          </p>
          <h2>About Me and Chemistry</h2>
          <p>
            Prior to the software career, I was a formulations chemist. Had the
            pleasure of working on various drugs from peptides, hormones,
            anti-cancer drugs, opioids, vasopressors and more. Designing
            experiments and carrying them out has a slower iteration loop than
            programming, but they both involve planning, anticipating problems,
            troubleshooting, and effective execution.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love learning, making plans, and executing them. I enjoy the
            process of iteration and I like to think I voraciously apply it in
            multiple domains of my life.
          </p>

            Fun Things
            <div class="tiny">updated Nov 2022</div>
          </h2>
          <p>
            I started sport climbing outdoors in the summer of 2022 and visited
            crags in North Bend, Mt. Erie, Frenchman Coulee, and Squamish for
            the first time. I've had the fortune of meeting many new friends who
            are positive, driven, and stoked to climb--and also lucky to
            accumulate more climbing trips with a set of great people.
          </p>
          <p>
            One challenge continues to be balancing my enjoyment of the classic
            deadlift and bench press with the recovery time that climbing skill
            acquisition seems to require from me. I love that climbing gyms have
            power cages, barbells, and an assortment of free weights. I have
            started playing around with hangboarding and spray walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been sketching sporadically, but I haven't been consistent
            about that. Drawing is more of a "do it if I feel like it" hobby. I
            really enjoy my Pentel GraphGear 1000 for pencil drawing. I also
            like writing notes with Pentel EnerGel 0.5mm, and Sakura Pigma
            Micron 05 for making holiday and birthday cards.
          </p>
          <p>I got 100% of the Steam achievements for Age of Empires IV...</p>
          <h2>Current Tech-Related Focus</h2>
          <p>Make it work, make it right, make it fast...</p>
          <p>
            Working on being aware of tradeoffs with every design decision.
            Paying attention to how more senior engineers make architectural
            decisions and what they do when they hit gnarly problems. Looking
            for ways to review code more efficiently and informatively.
            Understanding how to accumulate beneficial influence in an
            organization and advocate for myself, my team, and doing the right
            thing.
