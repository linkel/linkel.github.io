        <h2>About Me <div class="tiny">updated Mar 2020</div></h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm a software engineer who has most recently worked at a fleet telematics company with a mission to improve driver safety. 
          Prior to my software development career, I was a formulation chemist in the pharmaceutical industry 
          at a company that received FDA approval for their novel drug that treats septic shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love learning more about how things work, or why they are the way they are. The universe is bizarre and within every small slice of a discipline 
          we can always zoom in more until we reach an abyss in our understanding. 
          From my small corner of a career journey, there's been so much to learn--about small molecules and proteins, about software design, and about people. 
        </p>
        <h2>Current Focus <div class="tiny">updated Mar 2020</div></h2>
        <p>
          Working on being more thoughtful about "just getting it to work" versus maintainability of code. 
          Been slowly chewing through Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual. 
          Would like to finish that nand2tetris course.
          Would also like to read a book about computer networking. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently on a minimal powerlifting strength maintenance routine while I continue to explore rock climbing. Bouldering is the primary focus for now because I find it the most fun! 
          Some friends roped (heh) me into a lead climbing course--it was an excellent experience. Further exploration to be determined.
        </p>
