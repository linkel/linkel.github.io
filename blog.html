            My Windows 10 Start Menu wouldn't stay open after I clicked on it. It'd open briefly and immediately disappear. I was still able to search for applications if I typed quickly, but couldn't use the UI to shut down my PC. In my case, it turned out to be because of Live Tiles! Here's how I fixed it.
