# Workplace Poker

## Why I started reading it

There was a post in Hacker News that quoted from the book. I became curious and decided to read it. 

Time it took: 3 - 4 hours. 

A smooth read--the author peppers a lot of anecdotes all over each chapter to facilitate envisioning what he means with each advice segment. Some anecdotes have a feel of being pretty modified. Obviously to protect identities, but it's definitely rather altered (I'm thinking of the chlorine railway spill one where the deaths didn't line up with the real-world incidents). 

## Summary

Learn what your coworkers' baseline behavior is so that when they deviate from this pattern you can begin to assess whether something is going on to better ascertain their motivations. People are super complex and interesting in their desires and their wide-ranging behavior, and how they interact with others and react to stressful or victorious situations and behave under different power dynamics. Observing this without passing judgment sets you up for more understanding and data-gathering, and potentially you can use this information to better help others, or solve problems, or see catastrophe in the future and prepare for it. 

Businesses have different cultures. The values that one prefers may be so different that if you're in one but your style is the other, you could stagnate in your career. Or be stymied and not figure out why, if you don't pause to observe the people around you.

If shit happens to you, make sure you internally take all responsibility for it and figure out how you could have avoided it (since even if you're totally blameless for that specific incident, you still took steps to get yourself in that situation). Letting yourself off the hook by blaming it on other people doesn't help you maximally grow and learn how to improve or prepare for next time. However, internally taking responsibility doesn't mean externally saying it's all your fault--do clarify facts on the situation with people and explain as best as you can and as wisely as you can. The "taking all responsibility" is relevant for your internal mindset. Don't retain a victim mentality, basically. 

Understand what drives you and continue to fuel your own fire. Author asserts that there's four energies that need to be going strong. Physical, Mental, Emotional, Aspirational. Many people focus on the aspirational (aka where do I want my career to go) because it's the most fun and obvious but if you don't have your other three energy sources sorted out you will be in a weaker position to achieve the last one. Physical comes from being in shape, physically reasonably fit, because our bodies and our minds are the same. Over time being physically weak or unfit makes you less resilient to stress and less capable of working hard--you could power through for a long time but eventually it accumulates. Also the side aspect of other people preferring to work with someone more attractive and healthy and appealing due to natural biases. Looking good and strong makes you seem like a better leader or a better salesman or a more trusted worker. 

Mental comes from working on challenging, imore the hard stuff. If we don't get to use it we feel less invigorated, or if we waste it on mindless drudgery we don't feel so good, or we sometimes won't be prepared when a sudden problem arises. 

Emotional energy comes from feeling like you matter, that people support you and value you and you can also support others and they appreciate you. It comes from feeling like a human being instead of a nameless cog in a behemoth machine. 

And finally Aspirational energy comes from feeling like you're able to make progress, that you're improving and rising in the ranks and going up the slope of your life in your career or whatever else you dedicate yourself to. Being able to aim for goals and forge your way towards them. 

Handling rejection is important. Be closer to the "robust rejection-handling" end of the spectrum than the dainty afraid-of-any-rejection side. But make sure you aren't so tough-skinned that nothing at all matters and you stay stubbornly stuck in your way that doesn't work because you don't give a shit way too hard. There's a difference between not being able to give any shits versus being able to and choosing not to. 

Show off your skills as appropriate. Don't be obnoxious about tooting your own horn since it's transparent and easy for people to smell. But do market yourself and don't expect that people will be able to discern your hard work without you making some emphasis about it. 

Going back to the physical energy, stay fit, do some cardio and some strength training, and eat clean so you feel good and your body is happy. Being extremely unhealthy or not taking care of appearance (like obese, heavy breathing, bad teeth and odor, unable to participate in team bonding activities due to health, unkempt hair) will eventually bar you from making the maximum career progress because human beings are wired to prefer good-looking, healthy, strong folk. 

Be charming! If you aren't, know that it's a skill you can work on. Can improve your clean humor skills. Can really be engaged in a conversation when you are talking to someone, don't be distracted--people can tell when you don't care. If you don't give a shit about them, why? All people are interesting in some way, or know something you don't, or at the most cynical, can be useful. The world, all of society, is a tribal activity with lots of social navigation. How many of the issues that you have other people are projections from your insecurities or your discomfort with new things or your inability to adapt? Not saying other people are all perfect but just that being able to interact well and make other people laugh or feel good or want to help you is a valuable skill that has a force multiplier. That said, there are definitely some sociopaths/psychopaths/narcissists/dangerous people out there. Do take care of yourself and make the right decision. Just be aware of your own flaws too.
