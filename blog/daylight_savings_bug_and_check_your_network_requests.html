          Daylight Savings Bug, and Check Your Network Requests
        </h1>
        <p>
          So let's say we have a date picker component. Using it, we can select
          a date range on a calendar of up to 180 days to pull up workouts
          belonging to different lifters with possible form issues in their
          squats and benches and deadlifts. These form issues get determined by
          some algorithm on the videos (like for bar path deviating
          significantly from an ideal path, knees buckling in til they nearly
          touch, lumbar spine curvature, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          In this application we limit the date selection to 181 days, which is
          the 180 days plus today. Both the front end and the backend validate
          on this. The validator in the backend checks the start and end date
          and subtracts them to make sure that the difference is not more than
          181 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our front end is written in Angular 2+ and the backend is C#. Here is
          the backend validation:
        </p>
        <pre><code>RuleFor(request =&gt; request.StartDate).NotEmpty().WithMessage(StartDateRequiredMessage);
          RuleFor(request =&gt; request.EndDate).NotEmpty().WithMessage(EndDateRequiredMessage);
          RuleFor(request =&gt; request).Must(req =&gt; req.StartDate &lt;= req.EndDate)
          .WithMessage(StartDateLaterThanEndDateMessage);
          RuleFor(request =&gt; request).Must(req =&gt; (req.EndDate - req.StartDate).TotalDays &lt;= 181)
          .WithMessage(LessThan181DaysMessage);
          </code></pre>
        <p>
          We have another datepicker in another section of the application that
          does the same exact thing, but instead of looking at workouts with
          form tips it looked at special meetings that lifters would have with
          their coaches that would record information about what they discussed.
          Let's call the first one the Workout List Datepicker and the second
          one the Coaching Datepicker.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bug was reported for the Coaching Datepicker where the user could
          select the max range of dates allowed by this datepicker and yet get
          an error. Looking into the error revealed that it was failing at the
          <code>req.EndDate - req.StartDate.TotalDays &lt;= 181.</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Playing around with the date range showed that it had to do with
          daylight savings time--specifically when one hour was added to a day
          in November. This meant that originally, subtracting the start date
          from the end date would always result in something 181 or less,
          because it would be 180 days permitted and including the current day.
          When DST was added to the picture, this meant that it would be 181
          days plus an extra hour, and so it would fail to validate the model
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was confused at why the first one was fine and the second one was
          having issues, since they do the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I compared code in different areas of the application and was having
          quite a hard time finding out what was different. The validation was
          exactly the same. In the front end, it stored the date as an
          <code>ngbDateStruct</code> in both.
        </p>
        <p>I opened up Chrome's network tab and compared the requests.</p>
        <p>The failing one's query params:</p>
        <pre><code>?groupIds=2bb2d9b4-c801-e111-81ce-e61f13277aab&amp;
          selfGroupIds=&amp;formIds=&amp;lifterIds=&amp;coachIds=&amp;
          pageNumber=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;startDate=2018-09-04T07:00:00.000Z&amp;
          endDate=2019-03-04T08:00:00.000Z&amp;sortDirection=desc</code></pre>
        <p>The working one's query params:</p>
        <pre><code>?videoGroupIds=2bb2d9b4-c801-e111-81ce-e61f13277aab&amp;
          selfVideoGroupIds=&amp;startDate=2018-9-4&amp;endDate=2019-3-4&amp;
          pageNumber=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;triggerIds=&amp;statusIds=&amp;formIds=&amp;
          gymIds=&amp;lifterIds=&amp;includeAllLifterAndCoachVideos=true&amp;
          sortField=RecordDateLocal&amp;sortDirection=desc</code></pre>
        <p>
          Wait a second... The format of the date on the requests is different!
        </p>
        <p>
          In our failing one, the date format in the GET request query params
          looked like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&amp;startDate=2018-09-04T07:00:00.000Z&amp;endDate=2019-03-04T08:00:00.000Z</code></pre>
        <p>In the working one, the date format looked like this:</p>
        <pre><code>&amp;startDate=2018-9-4&amp;endDate=2019-3-4</code></pre>
        <p>
          So the failing one is in ISO format, and the working one truncates it
          to the day. If I had taken a couple more steps in investigating the
          front-end code, I would have seen that before the request was sent
          out, it does go through a conversion in a different component.
        </p>
        <pre><code>const startDate = NgbDateHelper.ngbDateToISOString(req.startDate);</code></pre>
        <p>
          I had to get some history about how this came about. Turns out that
          the working one was written purposefully inaccurately because users
          would be viewing information for someone else potentially in another
          timezone, and they'd select the day that the person told them they had
          worked out, but not get the information because the timezone was off
          and technically it was an earlier or later day in the viewer's
          timezone. So implementing it inaccurately on purpose resulted in
          easier usability. When this inaccurate request gets to the backend,
          it's assumed to be at midnight by the validator so subtracting them
          always stays below 181 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accurate one would fail because 1 hour does get added to a day
          from daylight savings time. Our solution, then, was simply to edit the
          validator to 182 days.
        </p>

            Daylight savings time with adding and subtracting an hour in
            November and in March is something to keep in mind!
          </li>
          <li>
            Look at the network tab in Chrome to check what the requests look
            like. Can also use Fiddler for more information.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large codebase, check the services being called as well.
            Understand what happens at the interface between the front-end and
            the back-end.
