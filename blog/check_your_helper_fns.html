          Remember To Check Your Helper Functions
        </h1>
        <p>
          Let's say I have an app that displays bundles of lifting session
          videos. Lifters who lift in this special power cage in the gym will
          have automated video taken of their lifts. Each training session of
          video will go into these bundles of videos. Each video can have the
          lifter reassigned (if identification of the lifter was mistaken), or
          can have the club reassigned (if the lifter is in a specific team or
          club) if the user has edit permissions for those actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, a new feature has been added where coaches can notify lifters to
          check out bundles of video here to see what aspects of their form
          could be improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a specific view of this app, there's a menu for each of these
          bundles that has the options for reassigning the lifter or the
          club--and now, I've added the ability to notify a lifter here too in
          the same menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously my hypothetical app only allowed any of these
          functionalities if there was a single video. That is, a bundle
          contained only one video. If a bundle contained multiple videos of
          different lifts, the reassigning lifter or club button was not present
          in a menu (let's be vague and chalk it up to specific permissions edge
          cases). Since we're adding this new feature for notifying, we want to
          make it so that lifters can be notified to watch every single video on
          the bundle, so bundles with multiple videos now will have the notify
          button (assuming they have the permission to notify them).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we are writing tests in TypeScript, making use of Jasmine and
          Karma.
        </p>
        <p>While I was writing tests, we already had this describe:</p>
        <pre><code>describe(&#39;When LiftingVideoContentComponent is initialized&#39;, () =&gt; {
      
              beforeEach(async () =&gt; {
                  setupStubData();
                  setupMocks();
      
                  await createTestFixture(expectedBundle);
              });</code></pre>
        <p>where setupStubData() had:</p>
        <pre><code>function setupStubData(): void {
              expectedSingleVideo = new LiftingVideoViewModelStub({
                  videoId: &#39;SQUAT_1_ID&#39;,
                  recordDateUtc: &#39;2019-04-19T21:22:41.379Z&#39;,
                  recordDateTz: &#39;PST&#39;,
                  groupName: &#39;West Coast Powerlifting Club&#39;,
              });
      
              expectedSingleVideoBundle = new LiftingVideoBundleStub(
                {videos: [expectedSingleVideo]}
                );
              
      // in this example, our LiftingVideoBundleStub contains by default five lifting videos
              expectedMultipleVideosBundle = new LiftingVideoBundleStub({});
          }</code></pre>
        <p>
          And inside the while LiftingVideoContentComponent is initialized
          describe block, we write testing code meant for if the bundle has a
          single video:
        </p>
        <pre><code>describe(&#39;And the bundle has a single video&#39;, () =&gt; {</code></pre>
        <p>
          Since previously when the bundle had multiple videos, there weren't
          any available buttons in the menu, there weren't any tests for
          checking combinations of buttons present in the menu. Now we do want
          multiple videos to have the one button to &quot;Notify Lifter&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my tests, I am using a mock of our permissions service. We have
          permissions to control who gets to reassign lifters or clubs, and now
          a new permission that controls whether a user can notify a specific
          lifter.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function setPermissions(reassignLifterPermission: boolean, reassignClubPermission: boolean, 
        notifyLifterPermission: boolean): void {
          mockPermissionsService
              .hasPermission.and.callFake((permission: PermissionKeys, groupId: string) =&gt; {
                  switch (permission) {
                      case PermissionKeys.VIDEO_LIFTER.EDIT:
                          return reassignLifterPermission;
                      case PermissionKeys.VIDEO_CLUB.EDIT:
                          return reassignClubPermission;
                      case PermissionKeys.VIDEO_LIFTER.NOTIFY:
                          return notifyLifterPermission;
                      default:
                          throw new Error(&#39;No valid permissions passed in&#39;);
                  }
          });
          createFixtureAndDetectChanges(expectedSingleVideoBundle);
      }</code></pre>
        <p>
          We use this createFixtureAndDetectChanges function to set up the test
          fixture after changes have been made that will affect which menu
          options will display.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, after configuring the testing module, setting up
          declarations and providers and imports at the start for the testing,
          this function would usually be called.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function createFixtureAndDetectChanges(bundle: LiftingVideoBundle) {
          fixture = TestBed.createComponent(LiftingVideoContentComponent);
          fixture.componentInstance.bundle = bundle;

          // displayOptions controls whether any options would be displayed at all, 
          // since these components are reused elsewhere in contexts where it wouldn&#39;t 
          // make sense to be able to edit properties

          fixture.componentInstance.displayOptions = true; 
      
          componentElement = fixture.debugElement;
      
          fixture.autoDetectChanges(true);
      }</code></pre>
        <p>where componentElement is described in the top describe block as:</p>
        <pre><code>    let fixture: ComponentFixture&lt;LiftingVideoContentComponent&gt;,
          componentElement: DebugElement;</code></pre>
        <p>
          So createFixtureAndDetectChanges sat at the end of setPermissions so
          that it wouldn't need to be rewritten repeatedly inside the testing
          code, since the testing code would constantly be changing the
          permissions to make sure the right menu options were displaying.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I set up my describe block for testing when the bundle had
          multiple videos...
        </p>
        <pre><code>describe(&#39;And the bundle has multiple videos&#39;, () =&gt; {
          beforeEach(async () =&gt; {
              await resetTestFixture();
              await createTestFixture(expectedMultipleVideosBundle);
          });
          
          describe(&#39;And the user has reassign lifter and reassign club permissions 
          and notify lifter permission&#39;, () =&gt; {
      
            beforeEach( () =&gt; {
                setPermissions(true, true, true);
            });
            
            it(&#39;should only show notify lifter button&#39;, () =&gt; {
              expect(filterDisplayedMenuItemByLabel(contextMenu,&#39;Reassign Lifter&#39;).length).toBe(0);
              expect(filterDisplayedMenuItemByLabel(contextMenu, &#39;Reassign Club&#39;).length).toBe(0);
              expect(filterDisplayedMenuItemByLabel(contextMenu, &#39;Notify Lifter&#39;).length).toBe(1);
            });
              
          )};
      });</code></pre>
        <p>My test failed!</p>
        <p>
          I was pretty puzzled. I set breakpoints in Chrome. I stepped through
          and the check occurring in my code that looked at if the bundle's
          elements length was 1 to toggle the showing of the option was working.
          But I did notice that it was flipping through the check multiple
          times. I expected it to go through the check for an element length
          equal to 1 one time because of the top level describe block, then go
          into a check where the element length would be equal to 5 (my default
          multiple video stub). Instead it was hitting a length 1 check, my
          length 3 check, and then a length 1 again before actually running the
          test, and would then promptly fail.
        </p>
        <p>It turned out that it was this line here, in my setPermissions.</p>
        <pre><code>createFixtureAndDetectChanges(expectedSingleVideoBundle);</code></pre>
        <p>
          It would always restart the fixture using a single video bundle
          instead of the multiple one.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took me too long to catch it because I had assumed my helpers were
          functioning the way I envisioned them to be, and was looking in the
          describe blocks incessantly thinking there was something mysterious
          about await fixture.whenStable() or any of the other await functions
          sitting around.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it seems like these are a few useful heuristics when debugging code
          in a large codebase:
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>Breakpoint through your component and the spec file.</li>
          <li>
            If you have booleans that are calculated from many ANDs that rely on
            function results, set them to const variables to be able to hover
            over them in Chrome and see their value.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an action is happening more times than you expect, think about
            why it is! Don't ignore it and chalk it up to vague thoughts on
            asynchronous flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Double check your helper functions. Don't get suckered into thinking
            it does what it says on the label.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you're await-ing something that needs to get awaited, if
            you're working with async processes.
          </li>
        </ol>
