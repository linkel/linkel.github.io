# Introduction

Having a personal website is interesting. It feels simultaneously like too much work yet also not much work at all. When I sit down and get started with something on the site, I find that time passes pretty quickly. But it's difficult in the first place to get started with changes. 

It's fun writing a blog. Currently I am using pandoc to convert my markdown to html. Eventually I'd like to make this process more automated.

To my horror, I discovered recently that I have forgotten about my LESS file when revamping the site and adding blog articles, and instead have been making edits to the CSS file. I'm going to have to refactor this...

# To Do:
* [x] Get the blog up
* [ ] Write one blog article per month in 2019
    * [x] June
    * [x] July
    * [x] Aug
    * [ ] Sept
* [ ] Refactor the CSS!
* [ ] How can I automate the pandoc conversion more and slap my headers on easily?
* [ ] If I have a fun topic to give another talk on, I can put more slides up on the Talks page.
